# Force Pinyin CN - Microsoft Pinyin Chinese Mode Enforcer

[‰∏≠Êñá](./README_cn.md)

Microsoft Pinyin has an annoying issue where the input method may unexpectedly switch to English mode automatically. This forces users through the tedious process of "typing incorrectly - checking input method - confirming Chinese/English mode - finally entering Chinese mode".

This small tool was created to address this issue, specifically optimized for Microsoft Pinyin input method.

## Features

- üéØ **Auto Switch**: Automatically switches to Chinese mode when Microsoft Pinyin English mode is detected
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: Real-time display of input method status, including language mode, punctuation status, etc.
- üß† **Smart Protection**: When user actively presses Shift to switch, auto-switching is disabled for 0.5 seconds

## Usage

### Method 1: Using Compiled Executable

Run `force_pinyin_cn.exe` directly:

```bash
# Continuous monitoring mode
./force_pinyin_cn.exe

# Single check mode
./force_pinyin_cn.exe --test
```

### Method 2: Using Python Source Code

```bash
# Continuous monitoring mode
python force_pinyin_cn.py

# Single check mode  
python force_pinyin_cn.py --test
```

### Exit
No tray functionality implemented. To exit, please terminate the process in Task Manager.

## Operation Instructions

### Continuous Monitoring Mode
- The program continuously monitors input method status and Shift key press events
- When Microsoft Pinyin English mode is detected, it automatically switches to Chinese mode
- Smart recognition of user-initiated Shift switching: if Shift press is detected within 0.5 seconds, auto-switching is skipped
- Real-time display of current input method status and active window information
- Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the program

### Single Check Mode
- Performs a one-time input method status check
- Displays detailed input method information
- If switching is needed, attempts to execute the switch operation

## Output Example

```
Starting input method status monitoring... Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Auto-switch function enabled: Will automatically switch to Chinese mode when Microsoft Pinyin English mode is detected
Smart protection function enabled: If Shift key press is detected within 0.5 seconds, auto-switching will be skipped

## System Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Microsoft Pinyin Input Method
- Python 3.6+ (if running from source code)

## Development Build

To recompile the executable file, use the following command:

```bash
python -m nuitka --onefile --windows-console-mode=disable --noinclude-dlls=libcrypto-3.dll --windows-icon-from-ico=.\icon.ico force_pinyin_cn.py
```

## Notes

- This tool only works on Windows systems
- Requires Microsoft Pinyin input method support
- The program needs permissions to read system input method status and keyboard key status
- The program automatically detects if an instance is already running at startup, and exits if one exists
- Smart protection function identifies user-initiated switching behavior by monitoring Shift key

## Troubleshooting

If the program doesn't work properly, please check:
1. Whether Microsoft Pinyin input method is installed
2. Whether the input method is working properly
